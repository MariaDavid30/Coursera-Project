The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

In run_analysis.R ,the final dataset is obtained by

1.Downloading the data.
2.Reading all the files of the dataset into R.
3.Merging the datasets to obtain a single dataset.
4.choosing only  the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
5.Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6.Giving appropriate variable names to the data from the feature data file.
7.Thereby creating a table of this tidy dataset.

Refer the run_analysis.R to understand the Variables used to create the final tidy dataset.
